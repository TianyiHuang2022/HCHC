# HCHC
Python implementation of HCHC. Run "GLDC.py" for clustering and then run "HCHCmapping.py" for visualization. If you use our code or data please cite "High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle".


The method is tested on MNIST. Networks are trained by PyTorch 2.0 and Python 3.9.
Visualization is based on pandas 1.5.3 and matplotlib 3.7.1.
